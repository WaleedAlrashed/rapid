# Rapid UI

Rapid JavaScript development environment for building UI
(based on the Atomic Design Metho..)


## Todos
[ ] Add a deploy script.
[ ] Add treeshaking to webpack.
[ ] Hashing all the copied files from static using something like `file-loader` and `url loader`.
[ ] Improve caching (hash, chunk hash, or content hash?).
[ ] Add @storybook/html ("storybook": "start-storybook -p 6006").
[ ] Add Flow config ("flow": "flow check").

## Issues
[ ] Static files are not updated when modified.
